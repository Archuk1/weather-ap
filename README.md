# Weather‑ap

Weather‑ap is a lightweight web application that lets users view current weather data for any city. The app is built with HTML, CSS and JavaScript, using a public weather API for retrieving weather information. The user types in a city (or uses a location search), and gets displayed the current weather conditions — e.g. temperature, humidity, wind, weather description, etc.

⚙️ Technologies & Structure

Frontend is implemented using vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS, with a build configuration based on modern tools (Vite + package.json).

The project is structured as a standalone single‑page application: the source code lives under src, and static assets under assets.

📡 Functionality

Fetches real–time weather data from a weather API (for instance like many other weather‑apps do) and displays it in a user‑friendly way.

Allows the user to search by city name.

Presents weather information in a clean UI with minimal dependencies.

🎯 Purpose & Use

The goal of Weather‑ap is to provide a simple, accessible tool for checking current weather — useful as a small side project, a demo, or as a base for further enhancements (e.g. adding forecast, location auto‑detect, better UI). It’s a good example of how to build a small web app with modern JS tooling and API integration.
